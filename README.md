Computer Vision based technology for fruit quality analysis.

Computer Vision is increasingly being used in agriculture and fruit industry. 
Computer vision systems offer quick, affordable, and reliable assessment. 
Fruit's appearance is one of its key quality attributes.
Appearance not only influences their market value, the preferences and the choice of the consumer, but also their internal quality to a certain extent. 

Fruits change their color when they rot.
Thus simple thresholding techniques give good results.
